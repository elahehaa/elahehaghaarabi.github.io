Identifying different categories of randomized trial publications from the vast volume of publications is a significant challenge for the public health community. Our recent work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) focuses on employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify various categories of biomedical research from literature.
