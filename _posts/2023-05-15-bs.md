Beam search is an algorithm utilized in generative models to find the most likely sequence of tokens. It explores multiple potential output sequences simultaneously, aiming to identify the most promising candidate.

### How Beam Search Works

1. **Initialization**: The model initializes a beam of k ( k = 3 candidate sequences.
   - Beam 1: "The cat" _ (possible tokens: sat, ran, slept)
   - Beam 2: "The cat" _ (possible tokens: jumped, purred, played)
   - Beam 3: "The cat" _ (possible tokens: ate, drank, meowed)
   
3. **Expansion**: At each step, the model generates all possible next tokens for each of the k candidate sequences in the beam.
   - For each beam:
     - Beam 1: "The cat sat", "The cat ran", "The cat slept"
     - Beam 2: "The cat jumped", "The cat purred", "The cat played"
     - Beam 3: "The cat ate", "The cat drank", "The cat meowed"
   
5. **Scoring**: The model scores each candidate sequence based on a predefined scoring function.
   
6. **Iteration**: The process continues iteratively until the maximum sequence length is reached.



Through this iterative process, beam search helps the model generate coherent and contextually appropriate sequences of tokens.
