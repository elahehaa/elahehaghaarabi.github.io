My name is Elaheh. I am a Machine Learning/Data Scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in the [Office of Portfolio Analysis (OPA)](https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/opa) and the [Office of Disease Prevention](https://prevention.nih.gov/). In these roles, I focus on NLP and Deep Learning projects, developing ML pipelines to to support data-driven decision-making for public health policy community. My work has been extensively centered around Large Language Models, Transfer Learning, and the design of Recommendation Systems and Generative AI in the biomedical field on academic grants submitted to the NIH and biomedical publications from PubMed. Prior to that, I worked at the NIH's [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/) under the supervision of [Dr. Zhiang Lu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/Zhiyong-Lu) and [Dr. Qingyu Chen](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/qingyu-chen/), developing ML frameworks to capture sentence similarity of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

I completed a Master's degree at the Engineering department of the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Canada, and later pursued another Master's degree at the Computer Science department of [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/), in the US. My thesis, titled "Soft Computing Approaches for Drinking Water Qiality Assessment in Distribution Networks" focused on developing for assessing water quality within distribution networks. During this research, we established a multi-faceted decision-making platform designed to predict water quality in distribution networks. Leveraging historical data from Quebec City, we implemented Neural Networks at the [Advanced Control & Intelligent Systems (ACIS) Lab](https://www.uvic.ca/research/labs/acis/index.php). Our objective was to improve the accuracy of water quality predictions through the application of advanced statistical methods, and contributing to other fields of engineering.

Outside of work, I'm all about running races, hiking, climbing, skiing, and just soaking up nature. It's my way of hitting the refresh button for my brain.
